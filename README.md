# Central Tendency for Housing Data Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented data analysis using R. I used the libraries readr, dplyr, and DescTools which helped me to build the project. I analyze the data of housing in NY to gain a better understanding and insight of the cost of living in each of the boroughs.

In this project, I find the mean, median, and mode cost of one-bedroom apartments in three of the five New York City boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens as well as point out differences between the boroughs.
