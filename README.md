# Central Tendency for Housing Data Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented data analysis using R. I used the libraries readr, dplyr, and DescTools which helped me to build the project. I analyze the data of housing in NY to gain a better understanding and insight of the cost of living in each of the boroughs.

In this project, I find the mean, median, and mode cost of one-bedroom apartments in three of the five New York City boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens as well as point out differences between the boroughs.
 
### Note:

This data comes from Streeteasy.com 

### Results:

First, I imported the datasets of the one-bedroom apartments in the three New York City's boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. I wanted to know about the amount of rent for the apartments in each borough.
